# User List - a smail react project

## Note: 
It is not responsive and may contain quite a few bugs . I have never used 'mUi' before. So, it took a bit of time to learn the materials and create a theme within a day. Additionally, I created another theme using TailwindCSS. Due to the lack of time, there might be some bugs and it is not fully responsive.


## vite
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules. 

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
